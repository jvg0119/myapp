Hi,
I tried very hard but couldn't get the EpicEditor to work.

I followed this procedure here:
https://github.com/OscarGodson/EpicEditor
This is the site that bloc gave in the extra credit section.
I tried doing it on a different app (created a small app in Rails v4.2)
I tried different ways but mostly I was getting this error:

```
ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [GET] "/posts/1/lib/js/epiceditor.min.js"):
  actionpack (4.2.4) lib/action_dispatch/middleware/debug_exceptions.rb:21:in `call'
```

I tried other ways like using the gem 'epic-editor-rails' w/ rails 4.2
I got close here but it wasn't working very good.

If you could please help. I'd like to know how this work.
Otherwise, I guess I'll have to skip this part.
Thanks,
Joe


#===========
Hi,
Is anybody familiar with EpicEditor?
I'm try to add it to a rails form.
I'm using instructions from this site:  https://github.com/OscarGodson/EpicEditor
but I have tried different things and so far couldn't get it to work.
help please thanks



# ===============
I created a small app just to test and get EpicEditor to work first.
If I get it to work I'll move it to my Blocipedia app.
This is my setup:
Rails 4.2.4
Downloaded the EpicEditor from the github site.
Copied the images in the assets/images, the css files in the assets/stylesheets,
and the epiceditor.min.js in assets/javascripts  folder.

I tried them before in lib/epiceditor/ but didn't work there neither.

Im my _form.html.erb I have
```
...
<div id="epiceditor">
  <%= f.label :body %><br>
  <%= f.text_area :body %><br><br>
</div>

<div>
  <%= f.submit %><br>
</div>

<script src="/epiceditor.min.js">
  //var editor = new EpicEditor({basePath: '/lib/js/epiceditor'}).load(); // not currently using this
  var editor = new EpicEditor().load();
</script>
```

I get the error when I "refresh on edit" or just click on "edit" or click on "create new"

```
...
Completed 200 OK in 23ms (Views: 21.7ms | ActiveRecord: 0.1ms)


Started GET "/epiceditor.min.js" for ::1 at 2017-08-20 14:20:49 -0700

ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [GET] "/epiceditor.min.js"):
  actionpack (4.2.4) lib/action_dispatch/middleware/debug_exceptions.rb:21:in `call'
...
```
I can deploy it to github if you want me to.
